There are many different sensors or interesting modules you can use to create interesting projects. 

Have you ever wondered how can we get them to worküßê?

Here are some examples to get you prepared!

* ILI9341 - use SPI protocol to communicate with the screen to display the element.
* LCD1602 - use I2C protocol to communicate with the LCD to display the string or number.
* MidiPlayer - export the data from midi file and play the music by using four PWM signal.
* PCA9685 - use I2C protocol and PWM signal to activate the servo.
* SHT3x - use I2C protocol to communicate with the sensor to get the current temperature and humidity.
* SSD1315 - use SPI protocol to communicate with the screen to display the element.

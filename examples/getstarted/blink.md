Let's first come to an easy beginner project - blink the onboard LED. This example shows the simplest thing you can do with just a SwiftIO board to see physical output: it blinks the on-board REG LED.

For this project, we only need the SwiftIO board.

There is a built-in RGB LED on the board. You can control it using the methods in `DigitalOut` class.

_**Note**: the onboard LED will be turned on when you apply a **low** voltage._

Just plug the board to your computer through a USB cable after you finished code.

It's time for the code. Let's see how it works.You can find the example code at the bottom left corner of IDE: ![](../../.gitbook/assets/xnip2020-07-22_16-04-33.jpg) &gt; GettingStarted &gt; Blink.


```swift
// Import the library to enable everything in it, like relevant classes and methods. 
// This is first step for your coding process.
import SwiftIO

// Declare a constant. You may choose any descriptive name you like. 
// Initialize the onboard green LED. 
// The Id of onboard LED should be capitalized.
let green = DigitalOut(Id.GREEN) 

// In the dead loop, the code will run over and over again.
while true {
    // Output 3.3V to turn off the green LED.
    green.write(true)
    // Pause for a second. Or, you won't notice LED state change. 
    // During this period, the board will do nothing but just wait.
    sleep(ms: 1000)
    
    // Output 0V to turn on the green LED.
    green.write(false)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
}
```

## <span style="color:#EA5823;font-weight:700">Instruction</span>
`import SwiftIO` refers to this name library. In this tutorial, all case programs must first reference this library
let is a keyword for Swift language to declare constants. We will often use it to assign names to each port for easy reference in the future. `Id` is an enumeration. All types of enumeration Id can be viewed in See Also. Its members include all IO ports. You may be confused because RED, GREEN, and BLUE are not marked on pinMap. Because the SwiftIO board is equipped with RGB three-color LEDs by default and connected in series with resistors, the corresponding pins of the LEDs connected to the three ports are shown in the circuit diagram.
Setting the `while` loop to `true` means that the loop check will always be true, unless the hardware is powered off or restarted, the loop will not stop after entering. The loop body is the part of the loop code, enclosed by a pair of braces `{}` and needs to be indented for reading.
The `.write()` method belongs to the `DigitalOut` object and its incoming values ​​are `true` and `false`, which represent output high level (3.3V) and low level (0V or GND) respectively.
The `sleep(ms:)` function is a built-in function, which means the delay time, calculated in milliseconds, and the external name of the parameter `ms` must be added to pass in the parameter.

This example shows how to use the `PWMOut` to generate notes. It plays three tones repeatedly.

## <span style="color:#EA5823;font-weight:700">What you need</span>

- SwiftIO board
- Jumper wires
- Buzzer
- SwiftIO shield(optional)

## <span style="color:#EA5823;font-weight:700">Code</span>

```swift
// Produce different notes by changing the frequency of PWM signal.

// Import the library to enable the relevant classes and functions.
import SwiftIO

// Initialize a PWM output pin the speaker is connected to.
let speaker = PWMOut(Id.PWM2B)

// Specify several frequencies to produce different sound.
let fre = [262, 294, 330]

/// Play recurrently these notes.
while true {
    for f in fre {
        // Set the frequency and the duty cycle of output to produce each note.
        speaker.set(frequency: f, dutycycle: 0.5)
        // Play each note for one second.
        sleep(ms: 1000)
    }
    
}
```

## <span style="color:#EA5823;font-weight:700">Instruction</span>

The code above uses a Frequency as musical pitches. For example, NOTE_C4 is middle C, whose frequency is 262 Hz. Latter example MidiPlayer we will markdown all this muscial note in a file. This file contains all the pitch values for typical notes. You may find it useful whenever you want to make musical notes.
